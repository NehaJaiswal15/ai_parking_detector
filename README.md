# 🅿️ AI Parking Space Detection System

A real-time AI-powered parking space detection system built using YOLOv11, OpenCV, and Streamlit.
The project automatically detects vehicles in parking-lot footage and identifies which parking slots are occupied or vacant.
It provides a simple yet effective dashboard for monitoring parking space availability — making parking management smarter and more efficient.


## 🚀 Features

🎯 Real-time Detection: Uses YOLOv11 for fast and accurate vehicle detection

🅿️ Slot Monitoring: Detects which parking spaces are occupied or free using predefined polygons

💻 Streamlit Dashboard: Displays live analytics (total, occupied, free) and a real-time video feed

🎥 Video Upload Support: Works with parking-lot videos for easy testing

🟥🟩 Color-Coded Slots: Occupied slots in red, available slots in green

⚙️ CPU-Friendly: Runs efficiently on CPU; no GPU required
