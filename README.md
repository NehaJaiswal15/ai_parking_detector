🅿️ AI Parking Space Detection System

A real-time AI-powered parking space detection system built using YOLOv11, OpenCV, and Streamlit.
The project automatically detects vehicles in parking lot footage and identifies which parking slots are occupied or vacant.
It provides a simple yet effective dashboard for monitoring parking space availability — making parking management smarter and more efficient.

🚀 Features
🎯 Real-time Detection: Uses YOLOv11 for fast and accurate vehicle detection.
🅿️ Slot Monitoring: Detects which parking spaces are occupied or free using predefined polygons.
💻 Streamlit Dashboard: Displays live analytics (total, occupied, free spaces) and a real-time video feed.
🎥 Video Upload Support: Works with any parking-lot video feed for easy testing.
🟥🟩 Color-Coded Slots: Occupied slots shown in red, free slots in green.
⚙️ Scalable & Lightweight: Runs efficiently even on CPU without requiring GPU acceleration.
